# Overview
This is a program made for CS253: Problem Solving with C++, taught by Bruce Draper, in the Spring 2017 semester at CSU.
It's primary purpose is to take a document and a reading level range, returning a list of documents which are similar to the given document, but within the reading range requested.
As an example, a professor could have an article intended for experts which they found profoundly intriguing! 
They want to share some of this knowledge with their teenager. So they input the document name (with the document available in the same hierarchy), alongside the reading range they want.
The program will then parse the document and return (assuming they exist) documents which are appropriate for a different reading level, on the same subject!
Of course, this assumes the document exists and is available in the library the which the program has access. 

This program is considered finished at this time.
